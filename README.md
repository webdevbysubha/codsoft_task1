# Tribute Page - Admiring Someone Special

Welcome to my tribute page project! This webpage was created as part of my **Level 2 Task 1** for an internship at **CodSoft**. With a foundation in basic HTML and CSS, I dedicated this page to someone I truly admire, showcasing their admirable qualities with a simple yet visually appealing design.

This project reflects my journey in web development, combining creativity and technical skills. The webpage is a personalized tribute, expressing admiration through carefully crafted content, images, and stylistic choices. From experimenting with font styles to playing with background colors, this page demonstrates how a simple idea can come to life through code.
